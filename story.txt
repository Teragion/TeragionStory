There was a clever child named Garrett,
He found that there has to be an alias for GitHub
He reverted his name and deleted some characters 
He is now Teragion :)

Many people grew to know Teragion as a kind and hard-working individual. Determined and driven, Garrett studied diligently as his GitHub alias, Teragion.
Github is a nice tool,in Github, Teragion can study with other people and help them with their problem.
He can work on projects and communicate with his team in an efficient and effective manner. Nothing is out of reach for Teragion.

He keeps on practicing using git and programming, he is very happy.
