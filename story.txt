There was a clever child named Garrett,
He found that there has to be an alias for GitHub
He reverted his name and deleted some characters 
He is now Teragion :)

Many people grew to know Teragion as a kind and hard-working individual. Determined and driven, Garrett studied diligently as his GitHub alias, Teragion.
